# Principles :clipboard:
The repository outlines a list of principles used in software development to help guide developers and build great teams.

## Principle format

Principles are divided into a few parts

* Title: A succinct title that explains the principle
* What: Explanation of what it is
* Examples and links where necessary
* Exceptions: When these rules might not apply
* Definitions of terms: Words with overloaded or unclear meanings need to be explained (e.g. a unit test, define what unit means, or what a model is in MVC).
* Resources: Contributing towards the text or further reading

## Contributing
