## How

## Content

It is the founding principle that started Principle-Driven Development (PDD). The base principle behind every other principle and the purpose of PDD. It is the inspiration behind the metaphors of PDD.


## Exceptions

**Highly distributed systems** Some systems rely on data consistency to be reached eventually or may never need to have accurate data.
<!--**Between teams** This principle is harder to apply between different team specialisations such as front-end vs backend, teams within an organisation, between different systems: caching vs database or large distributed systems.-->
