Reveal what is hidden so it can be understood.

These are the patterns, behaviors, structures and interactions that make up a system or organization.

Code - communicating the abstract ideas and structure of programming so it can be shared between engineers.

A running programming - being able to peer inside of it, to see the changes that happen over time.

Data - revealing the patterns hidden within.

Teams and organizations - to expose the hidden dynamics and rationales operating on a team and the systems they engineer.

Individuals - understand what you know, codifying your habits into understood actions and principles.

## Why

Understanding allows better outcomes to be achieved. It improves producitivity. Without understanding, chaos reigns supreme and the systems and organizations that are built from that reflect that. Higher levels o. Buggy code, poor structure, unable to reach higher levels of complexity due to a poor base. If an ordered system is a city, then a chaotic system is a swamp.

An ordered system which is understood allows complexity to be built upon complexity.

It is akin to building a skyscraper. A skyscraper requires a strong foundation, a substructure, built on bedrock. Architects to design the overall look of the building, engineers to adapt the important sub-systems like the electrical and water systems. Construction engineers to build layer upon layer of interconnected floors to form a more complex system.

Chaotic systems and organizations are more akin to a village. Pockets of complexity can arise with individual contributors, with varying levels of quality. But they cannot leverage and build something like a skyscraper. The complexity

- Creates understanding. Understanding is what allows an outcome to be reached. The greater the understanding the better the communication, efficiency and effectiveness of a team.

- Improves productivity.
- Shares knowledge.

## How

Data

- Create visalizations that create insight. Convert data into visualizations that can be easily understood. (e.g. splunk)
  Code
- Use diagrams. Represent code in less abstract ways, such as drawing diagrams of a system using pen and paper or graphics design programs.
- Document systems visually. Log and visualize results of a system
  Teams
- Use principles to communicate beliefs and ideas.

## Content

Making the invisible visible is about communicating understanding. To the team and to the the user of the system.

Software is abstract in nature. It is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell a computer how to work, but computer instructions on their own are rarely understandable.

Using concepts such as objects and relationships, software systems Software systems are written to be understood by a human. With concepts such as objects and relationships which help the mind sense of a system.

An example of an implementation:

Being able to see every request through a production application. Watching in real time as the data arrives, moves around the system. Watching how it is transformed, combined and stored as moves into a database. All whilst revealing memory usage, garbage collections, highlighting areas where code is slow.

Drawing out relationships between parts of a system using a pen a paper or graphics design programs.

### Document systems visually

The human

TODO: How to does the main perceiving programming?

Then imagine instead of being a group of text files moving through the system, a 3D representation appears. The edge of the building the data approaches is a gate which represents the API. We watch as someone checks this data comes into the building gets checked by and then is let in. We follow it into the next room where it examines what the data looks like the data some more watching areas where of the different places of the app we visit, the model, the database connection, the frameworks the application is being held up by. We could go down this 3D structure, deeper and deeper until we get to the CPU, see how our data is converted into electrons and watch them buzz around the CPUs caches . How we visit each location and then finally leaves the

Making the invisible visible

This is a base principle which all principles inherit from. The result of that, is that all principles implicitly:

- Create understanding.
- Improve productivity.
- Shares knowledge.

All other principles do not need to mention the above benefits, as all principles will do the above.

Programming and the systems create from them are abstract in nature, they cannot be seen in the real world and are often hard to understand.

// Drawing parallels with the construction industry. In a construction project you can walk onto a construction site and view the physical structures.

In code, you cannot look at an unfamiliar codebase and quickly understand the interconnections, structure and architecture of the system.

Programming is like construction, if you entered a construction site at night time and all the lights were turned off. You cannot see what you're building. To see what is being created, you have to create the picture in your head, by manually parsing lines of code, reading documentation and have team members share concepts with you.

Principles are the lights that help make what is invisible, visible. Everyone has them, but they aren't often shared. By sharing understanding of why a system is designed the way it is. It is like walking into the construction site with the lights on.

The more principles that are defined and understood, the more visible a code base is.

Make the hidden principles, structure and ac which make up a technology organization understood and explicit.

Understand reality by making clear the behaviors that are acting upon a system.

Reduce complexity by giving clear explainations

Create understan

The system could be the code, team or organisation.
ideas, forces, complexity
Enable understanding of the abstract by revealing what is causing it to be the way something is

Abstract - "Existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence."
Enable understanding of the abstract by creating explicit for why the things are the way they are.

Make the hidden principles, ideas and behaviors which make up a technology organization understood and explicit.

## Why

- Understanding is what allows an outcome to be reached. The greater the understanding the better the communication, efficiency and effectiveness of a team.

## How

- Use Principles combined with Principle-Driven Development to illuminate the technology organization from the source code to the leadership level.
- Ask questions that seek to understand and illuminate.

## Content

It is the founding principle of Principle-Driven Development (PDD). The base principle behind every other principle and the purpose of PDD. It is broad in scope and purpose.

Programming is abstract in nature, it cannot be seen. Only the results of programming can be seen. This is also true of the behavior of an organization.
