Make things which are hidden from explanation or difficult to understand, be understood by illuminating and revealing the hidden forces that operate on a system.


## Why

* Creates understanding.
* Improves productivity.
* Shares knowledge.

## How

* Create visalizations that create insight. Convert data into visualizations that can be easily understood. (e.g. splunk)
* Use diagrams. Represent code in less abstract ways, such as drawing diagrams of a system using pen and paper or graphics design programs.
* Document systems visually. Log and visualize results of a system
* Use principles to communicate beliefs and ideas.


## Content

Making the invisible visible is about communicating understanding. To the team and to the the user of the system.

Software is abstract in nature. It is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell a computer how to work, but computer instructions on their own are rarely understandable.

Using concepts such as objects and relationships, software systems Software systems are written to be understood by a human. With concepts such as objects and relationships which help the mind sense of a system.


An example of an implementation:

Being able to see every request through a production application. Watching in real time as the data arrives, moves around the system. Watching how it is transformed, combined and stored as moves into a database. All whilst revealing memory usage, garbage collections, highlighting areas where code is slow.

Drawing out relationships between parts of a system using a pen a paper or graphics design programs.

### Document systems visually

The human

TODO: How to does the main perceiving programming?




 Then imagine instead of being a group of text files moving through the system, a 3D representation appears. The edge of the building the data approaches is a gate which represents the API. We watch as someone checks this data comes into the building gets checked by and then is let in. We follow it into the next room where it examines what the data looks like the data some more watching areas where  of the different places of the app we visit, the model, the database connection, the frameworks the application is being held up by. We could go down this 3D structure, deeper and deeper until we get to the CPU, see how our data is converted into electrons and watch them buzz around the CPUs caches . How we visit each location   and then finally leaves the



Making the invisible visible


This is a base principle which all principles inherit from. The result of that, is that all principles implicitly:

* Create understanding.
* Improve productivity.
* Shares knowledge.

All other principles do not need to mention the above benefits, as all principles will do the above.

Programming and the systems create from them are abstract in nature, they cannot be seen in the real world and are often hard to understand.



// Drawing parallels with the construction industry. In a construction project you can walk onto a construction site and view the physical structures.

In code, you cannot look at an unfamiliar codebase and quickly understand the interconnections, structure and architecture of the system.

Programming is like construction, if you entered a construction site at night time and all the lights were turned off. You cannot see what you're building. To see what is being created, you have to create the picture in your head, by manually parsing lines of code, reading documentation and  have team members share concepts with you.

Principles are the lights that help make what is invisible, visible. Everyone has them, but they aren't often shared. By sharing understanding of why a system is designed the way it is. It is like walking into the construction site with the lights on.

The more principles that are defined and understood, the more visible a code base is.
