+++

Code should be formatted the same way across a team and enforced automatically using tools.

##Â Why

* Code is more familiar. Code reviews, visual parsing and code comprehension all become easier.
* Less thinking required. New developers can adapt to coding standards straight away without knowing them, existing developers don't have to remember them.
* Learning happens rapidly. Coding conventions automatically enforced will expose the developer repeatedly to the same errors making learning comfortable and rapid.
* Less mistakes. Code errors are raised straight away. In some cases they are fixed automatically.
* Constrains choices. When there is less choice available, the team will be able to
* Reduces conflict.  removes conflict from minor decisions such as spacing

## How

* Use a static language to prevent errors.
* Use a linter (eslint, python) or formatter (gofmt).
* Adopt common conventions (pep8) from your language choice.
* In languages where a common convention hasn't been decided. Opt for popular third party configurations. There will be a higher chance that this will make third party libraries easier to read and the rules can be reduced to suit the teams preferences. It is significantly harder as a team to decide on possibly unknown individual rules from scratch and build your own standard.
