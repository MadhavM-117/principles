Code should be formatted in a similar way across a team and enforced using tools that allow that

##Â Why

* It reduces cognitive load - The code is easier to understand, progress is faster.
* The code is easier to parse
* It constrains choices to a team level and prevents use of features that aren't well understood by the team.
* If the code conventions are already decided, it removes conflict from minor decisions such as spacing
* Code reviews are easier

## How

* Use a linter or formatter



"gofmt
