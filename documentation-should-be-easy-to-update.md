When encountering documentation, it should be easy to make needed changes.

## Why

* Increases the chances that the documentation will be correct. The first time a developer interacts with documentation, is often the time they will spend most time looking at the documentation and encounter errors.
* Accurate documentation will make the team more productive.

## How

* Prioritise write access to the code base for all members, but especially new members of the team. It's often the time they are most likely to update but have the least access to do so.
