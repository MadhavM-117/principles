You should iterate sequentially on a focused chunk of work at a time. Once that chunk has been completed, THEN start the next chunk of work. This is opposed to doing multiple chunks of work at the same time and working on them simultaneously.

## Why

* Easier on the mind. Sequential working increases the chance that all relevant context associated with a chunk of work be kept in mind.
* Reduced context switching. Working on many related, but separate tasks, causes increased context switching.
