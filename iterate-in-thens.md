You should iterate sequentially on a focused chunk of work at a time. Once that chunk has been completed THEN start on the next chunk of work. This is opposed to doing multiple chunks of work at the same time, working on them simultaneously.

## Why

* Sequential working increases the chance that all relevant context associated with a chunk of work be kept in mind.
* Reduces context switching. Working on separate tasks, even if related, causes increased context switching.
* Reduced eventualities (cartesian?). Changing one thing at at time, means the amount of input can

## How

* Focus on defining work in a way that enables tasks to work with relevant context.
* When working, focus on a single task and add additional tasks as a separate task.

## Content

Iterating on tasks by focusing on one chunk of work is generally better than trying to do too many things at once.

A example task may be to upgrade 3 cores libraries that 10 applications use.

### Iterating in ANDs.

Go to the first application
update library 1 **AND** 2 **AND** 3 at the same time
**THEN** move on to the next application.

The complexity arises through having to work with lots of different changes

* steps to update the 3 libraries
* bugs arising from changing those libraries.
* The complex interactions that may arise from changing 3 libraries at the same time.
* Identifying which library the bug came from.


### Iterating in THENs approach:

Go to the first application
update library 1
**THEN** move onto to next application

This approach greatly focuses the engineer on the context an individual library and all the associated bugs or changes required.

The complexity is reduced to:

* steps to update the library
* bugs
