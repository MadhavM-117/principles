You should iterate sequentially on a focused chunk of work at a time. Once that chunk has been completed, THEN start the next chunk of work. This is opposed to doing multiple chunks of work at the same time, working on them simultaneously.

This applies to planning tasks as much

## Why

* Sequential working increases the chance that all relevant context associated with a chunk of work be kept in mind.
* Reduced context switching. Working separate tasks, even if related, causes increased context switching. Working on a focused task reduces that.
* Errors are more obvious when focusing



## How

* Focus on defining work in a way that enables tasks to work with relevant context.
* When working, focus on a single task and avoid getting distracted

## Content

No matter the engineer, the brain has a limit to the amount of context it can hold at any one time. Iterating on tasks by focusing on one chunk of work is generally better than trying to do too many things at once.

A task maybe set to upgrade 3 cores libraries that 10 of your applications use.

To iterate in ANDs you would go to one of those applications, update library 1 AND 2 AND 3 at the same time, then move on to the next application.

This would mean you will have to understand 3 sets of bugs and each time you


Iterating in THEN approach:

Go to the first application, update library 1 THEN move onto to next application and update the library there.

As your working through the applications, library 1 you have all the context for each app.
