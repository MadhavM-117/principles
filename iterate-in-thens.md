You should iterate sequentially on a focused chunk of work at a time. Once that chunk has been completed, THEN start the next chunk of work. This is opposed to doing multiple chunks of work at the same time and working on them simultaneously.

This applies to planning tasks as much

## Why

* Easier on the mind. Sequential working increases the chance that all relevant context associated with a chunk of work be kept in mind.
* Reduced context switching. Working separate tasks, even if related, causes increased context switching.
*





## How

* Focus on defining work in a way that enables tasks to work with relevant context.
* When working, do not try to do many things at once. Focus on the particular task
